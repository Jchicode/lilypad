# üå∫üê∏ lilypad
A simple and lightweight FVM "oracle" using Bacalhau. We're enabling calling Bacalhau jobs from smart contracts! 

This project harnesses the power of onchain compute with off-chain computations including tradional Oracle jobs, AI, ML and well any Docker or WASM job you can run on Bacalhau.

The work is primarily initially focussed on FEVM contract target.

**We're live on FVM Hyperspace***
Contract Address: 0x75B01cAeFF294f10d21ff3429C683230e3d8C9B6

See the examples folder for how to use this in your own contracts!
